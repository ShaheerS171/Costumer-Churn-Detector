# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction App

**Try the live app here:** [**🚀 Live Demo**](https://costumer-churn-detector-f8cxm56nmg9tusbmreimv5.streamlit.app/)

An interactive **Streamlit** web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn. This project uses a **Logistic Regression** model trained on a telecom customer dataset to help businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive steps to improve **customer retention**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Interactive Input Form**: Easily enter customer details through a user-friendly form with dropdowns, sliders, and text inputs.
-   **Real-Time Predictions**: Instantly receive churn predictions and the associated probability score.
-   **Data Preprocessing**: Includes automated handling of missing values, label encoding for categorical features, and data scaling to prepare inputs for the model.
-   **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained Logistic Regression model loaded via `joblib` for immediate use.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Backend & ML**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
-   **Frontend**: Streamlit
-   **Model Serialization**: Joblib

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-prediction-app.git
cd churn-prediction-app
```

2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**
It's recommended to create a virtual environment first.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ **Run the Streamlit App**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

## 📊 Model Information

-   **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
-   **Target Variable**: `Churn` (Encoded as 0 for 'No' and 1 for 'Yes')
-   **Key Metrics**:
    -   **Accuracy**: ~81%
    -   The model is optimized to have a higher **Recall**, ensuring it is better at identifying customers who are likely to churn, even if it means having a few more false positives.

## 🎯 Use Case

This application is designed for **telecom companies, subscription-based services, and customer success teams** that need a simple tool to predict customer churn. It allows them to quickly assess a customer's risk profile and implement retention strategies before it's too late.

---

## 📈 Potential Improvements

-   **Model Explainability**: Integrate SHAP or LIME to explain *why* a specific prediction was made.
-   **Batch Predictions**: Add a feature to upload a CSV file for predicting churn for multiple customers at once.
-   **Dashboard**: Include a dashboard page with visualizations of the training data.
-   **Model Comparison**: Allow users to select and compare predictions from different models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
-   **Containerization**: Add a `Dockerfile` to make the application easier to deploy.
